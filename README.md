# kickstarter-analysis
Analysis of kickstarter campaigns for a client looking to start a campaign for a play.

### Challenge

#### Analysis
Our graph shows that the best months to launch a campaign is in the beginning of summer (May or June).  Campaigns started at the end of the year tend to have poor rates of success.

Our second graph measure a campaign’s outcome based on their goal. This graph demonstrates that to have a higher than 50% probability of achieving your campaign’s goal, a campaign goal should be kept under $20,000.  To have a higher than 70% chance of achieving a campaign goal, the goal should be kept at $5,000 or less. Keeping your goal under $5,000 drastically increases a campaign’s chance of success.

#### Limitations
Although our data shows potential strategies for creating a successful campaign to fund a play, there are some limitations. For instance, our data does not show how long successful campaigns took to raise their campaign goal and whether these campaigns which realized their goals quickly were funded during the early summer months. A bar graph showing ranges of length of successful play campaigns would be helpful to illustrate this data.  On the x axis there would be ranges of dates from 0-15, 15-30, 30-45, and 45+ days for the campaign and the y axis would show number of successful campaigns within each range. 

Another limitation is that is does not illustrate whether the number of backers contributed to the success of a campaign. One way to analyze this would be to create a line graph that had successful, failed, and canceled campaigns on the y axis and along the x axis showed ‘count of backers’.  This could help us see whether the amount of backers contributed to overall campaign success.  Data like this would help inform clients of whether it would be useful to invest time and energy into promoting their campaign because it would show whether getting a minimum number of backers led to high rates of campaign success.
