# kickstarter-analysis
Analysis of kickstarter campaigns for a client looking to start a campaign for a play.

### Challenge

#### Analysis
Our graph shows that the best months to launch a campaign is in the beginning of summer (May or June).  Campaigns started at the end of the year tend to have poor rates of success.

Our second graph measure a campaign’s outcome based on their goal. This graph demonstrates that to have a higher than 50% probability of achieving your campaign’s goal, a campaign goal should be kept under $20,000.  To have a higher than 70% chance of achieving a campaign goal, the goal should be kept at $5,000 or less. Keeping your goal under $5,000 drastically increases a campaign’s chance of success.

#### Limitations
Although our data shows potential strategies for creating a successful campaign to fund a play, there are some limitations. Our overarching goal of this project was to see whether the length of a campaign contributes to its success or failure. This question is still largely unanswered based on our graphs. We would need to create additional visualizations to answer this question.

A comparative bar graph showing ranges of length of play campaigns would be helpful to illustrate this data.  On the x axis there would be ranges of dates from 0-15 days, 15-30 days, 30-45 days, and 45+ days for the campaign.  The y axis would show count of successful and count of failed campaigns within each range.  This would give us a better understanding of how the length of a campaign contributes to its success or failure. 

Another limitation is that is does not illustrate whether the number of backers contributed to the success of a campaign. This would be helpful to see whether campaigns that realized their goals in a short amount of time had many backers or just a few who made large donations. After finding the trends in length of a campaign, we could create a bar graph where the y axis would be count of backers of successful campaigns and the x axis would be the same as our above graph, ranges of length of campaign (0-15 days, 15-30 days, 30-45 days, and 45+ days). This could help us see whether the amount of backers contributed to the speed of campaign success.  Data like this would help inform clients of whether it would be useful to invest time and energy into promoting their campaign because it would show whether getting a certain number of backers led to quick campaign success.
